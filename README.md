👋 Hi, I’m Andrew Symister (Drew)

🔐 I specialize in Identity & Access Management (IAM), cloud identity security, and access governance within enterprise environments.

🧠 My work focuses on:
- Identity lifecycle (JML) automation
- Authentication & authorization (SAML, OAuth, OIDC, SCIM)
- Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, CyberArk, and hybrid identity systems
- Security-first design with real-world operational thinking

🛠️ I build hands-on labs and projects that mirror production IAM scenarios, emphasizing risk reduction, access control, and auditability.
